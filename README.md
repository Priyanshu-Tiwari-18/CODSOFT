This repository is for my internship projects.

Project 1:- Titanic Survival Prediction :-
This project is based on the famous *Titanic Dataset*. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.  
DATASET
The dataset contains information such as:
- PassengerId  
- Pclass (Ticket class)  
- Name, Sex, Age  
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)  
- Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked  
- Survived (Target variable)  
RESULT
- Achieved good prediction accuracy on test data.  

PROJECT 2:- Iris Flower Classification:-
This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species:  
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  
DATASET
The dataset includes the following features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  
- Species (Target Variable)  
RESULT
- Achieved high accuracy (>95%) with Random Forest and KNN classifiers.  
- Data is well-separated.

PROJECT 3:- Sales Prediction using Machine Learning:-
This project predicts product sales using features such as store type, item type, item visibility, etc. The main objective is to build a regression model that estimates sales accurately.
DATASET
The dataset contains columns like:  
- Item Identifier  
- Item Weight  
- Item Fat Content  
- Item Visibility  
- Item Type  
- Item MRP (Maximum Retail Price)  
- Outlet Identifier & Type  
- Outlet Establishment Year  
- Item Outlet Sales (Target Variable)    
RESULT
- Random Forest and XGBoost models provided the best results with lower RMSE.  
- Linear Regression underperformed due to non-linear relationships.
